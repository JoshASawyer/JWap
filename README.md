# JWap: A website mapper and SEO reporter...
## Website Mapper
When the program first starts you will be prompted to enter the URL of a website, copying and pasting the link SHOULD work.
After mapping the website a log file can be found in you current working directory under logs/{website_name}.txt.
If you choose to save the results an SEO report will be made and added to the bottom of the map_ file, found in the current working directory under map_{website_name}.txt
## SEO Reporter
The SEO report is a small summary of things that violate common SEO rules, found in the map_ file.
## Errors
This program is a very new and experimental project of mine, so expect errors. However having said that, if you do run into an error do not worry, I have error tracking* set up on this repository.

*By using the files in this repository you are agreeing to sending information about your PC to me in the case of an error
